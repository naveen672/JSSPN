About The Course
Mechatronics engineering is the design of computer-controlled electromechanical systems. The essence of it is that the design of the mechanical system must be performed together with the design of the electrical/electronic and computer control aspects that together, comprise a complete system. Mechatronics is a multidisciplinary field that refers to the skill sets needed in the contemporary, advanced automated manufacturing industry
From Hod's Desk
Mechatronics Engineering also called as Mechatronics, is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that focuses on the integration or combination of mechanical, electrical and electronics engineering systems, and also includes a combination of robotics, electronics, computer science, telecommunications, control systems and automation systems. In recent, the mechatronic systems are available in our daily life such as washing machines with electronic controls, smart refrigeration, cruise control technology in modern vehicles, etc. are the applications that are worked with such interdisciplinary branches. Considering the future growth and current trend of innovation and multidisciplinary approach, we have started this branch in our institute from 2000-2001.
